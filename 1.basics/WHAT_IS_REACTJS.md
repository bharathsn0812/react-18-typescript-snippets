# What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications. It allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. Its main goal is to be fast, scalable, and simple. React works only on user interfaces in applications, which corresponds to the view in the MVC template.

React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. It was initially deployed on Facebook's news feed in 2011 and later on Instagram in 2012. React allows developers to create web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes.
