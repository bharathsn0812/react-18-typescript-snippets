# Setting up the Development Environment

To start developing with React, you need to set up your development environment. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install Node.js and npm:**
   Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. npm is a package manager for Node.js. Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). npm is included with Node.js.

2. **Install a Code Editor:**
   Use a code editor like Visual Studio Code, Atom, or Sublime Text. Visual Studio Code is highly recommended due to its excellent support for JavaScript and React.

3. **Create a React Application:**
   Use Create React App, an officially supported way to create single-page React applications. Open your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-app
