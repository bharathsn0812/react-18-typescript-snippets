Introduction to Code Splitting:

Code splitting is a technique used to split your code into smaller chunks, which can be loaded on demand. This helps to reduce the initial load time of your application and improves performance.

                Code splitting allows you to split your code into various bundles which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel.
